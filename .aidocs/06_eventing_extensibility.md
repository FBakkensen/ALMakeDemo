# Eventing Model and Extensibility

## Published Events

**ALMakeDemo does not publish any custom events.** The extension follows a simple, direct implementation pattern without introducing custom business events or integration events. This is typical for basic demonstration extensions that focus on UI enhancement rather than complex business logic integration.

### Standard Event Participation
While no custom events are published, the extension participates in the standard Business Central event model through:
- **Page Triggers**: Responds to standard page events (OnOpenPage)
- **Standard Event Chain**: Participates in normal page loading and display events

## Subscribed Events

**ALMakeDemo does not implement any event subscribers.** The extension uses direct trigger implementation rather than the event-driven architecture pattern.

### Current Trigger Implementation
```al
trigger OnOpenPage();
begin
    Message('App published: Hello world');
end;
```

**Analysis:**
- **Direct Trigger**: Uses built-in page trigger rather than event subscription
- **Simple Implementation**: Appropriate for basic demonstration purposes
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained logic without relying on other object events

### Potential Event Subscription Opportunities
If the extension were to be enhanced with event-driven patterns, suitable candidates would include:

| Event Publisher | Event Name | Potential Usage |
|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Customer Table | OnAfterInsertEvent | Log new customer creation |
| Customer Table | OnAfterModifyEvent | Audit customer changes |
| Customer List Page | OnAfterGetRecordEvent | Perform custom calculations |
| Sales Header | OnAfterInsertEvent | Initialize customer-specific defaults |

## Interfaces

**ALMakeDemo does not define or implement any interfaces.** The extension follows a simple inheritance pattern through page extension rather than interface-based architecture.

### Interface Opportunities for Enhancement
If the extension were to be expanded, potential interface implementations could include:

#### 1. Customer Enhancement Interface
```al
// Hypothetical interface for customer data enhancement
interface ICustomerDataEnhancer
{
    procedure EnhanceCustomerData(var Customer: Record Customer): Text;
    procedure ValidateCustomerData(Customer: Record Customer): Boolean;
}
```

#### 2. Display Formatter Interface
```al
// Hypothetical interface for field formatting
interface IFieldFormatter
{
    procedure FormatAmount(Amount: Decimal): Text;
    procedure FormatTooltip(FieldName: Text): Text;
}
```

## API Pages/Queries

**ALMakeDemo does not expose any API endpoints.** The extension focuses on UI enhancement rather than programmatic data access.

### API Properties Analysis
No objects in the extension contain API-related properties:
- No `APIPublisher` properties
- No `APIGroup` properties
- No `APIVersion` properties
- No `EntityName` properties
- No `EntitySetName` properties

### Potential API Enhancement
If API functionality were to be added, logical endpoints could include:

#### Customer Balance API
```al
// Hypothetical API page for customer balance data
page 50101 "Customer Balance API"
{
    APIPublisher = 'DefaultPublisher';
    APIGroup = 'ALMakeDemo';
    APIVersion = 'v1.0';
    EntityName = 'customerBalance';
    EntitySetName = 'customerBalances';
    SourceTable = Customer;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            field(customerNo; Rec."No.") { }
            field(name; Rec.Name) { }
            field(balanceDue; Rec."Balance Due") { }
        }
    }
}
```

## Other Extension Points

### Current Extension Mechanisms

#### 1. Page Extension Pattern
```al
pageextension 50100 CustomerListExt extends "Customer List"
```
**Extensibility Features:**
- **Layout Modification**: Adds fields to existing page layout
- **Trigger Enhancement**: Adds custom logic to page events
- **Non-Breaking**: Extends without modifying core objects

#### 2. Namespace-Based Organization
```al
namespace DefaultPublisher.ALMakeDemo;
```
**Benefits for Extensibility:**
- **Name Collision Prevention**: Ensures unique object naming
- **Logical Grouping**: Organizes related functionality
- **Future Expansion**: Supports adding more objects within same namespace

#### 3. ID Range Management
From app.json:
```json
"idRanges": [
    {
        "from": 50100,
        "to": 50149
    }
]
```
**Extensibility Support:**
- **50 Object Capacity**: Room for significant expansion
- **Proper Range Management**: Follows Business Central best practices
- **Conflict Prevention**: Ensures unique object IDs

### Build System Extension Points

The build automation system provides several extension mechanisms:

#### 1. Platform Script Extension
**Windows Enhancement**:
```powershell
# Additional script can be added to scripts/make/windows/
# Example: scripts/make/windows/test.ps1
```

**Linux Enhancement**:
```bash
# Additional script can be added to scripts/make/linux/
# Example: scripts/make/linux/test.sh
```

#### 2. Makefile Target Extension
```makefile
# Additional targets can be added to Makefile
test:
	$(SCRIPT_CMD) scripts/make/$(PLATFORM)/test$(SCRIPT_EXT) $(APP_DIR)

deploy:
	$(SCRIPT_CMD) scripts/make/$(PLATFORM)/deploy$(SCRIPT_EXT) $(APP_DIR)
```

#### 3. Library Function Extension
Shared libraries can be extended with additional functions:
- **common.ps1/sh**: Add new utility functions
- **json-parser.ps1/sh**: Add new configuration parsing capabilities

## Extensibility Architecture Assessment

### Current Architecture Strengths

### Potential Enhancements for Advanced Extensibility

#### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
```al
// Hypothetical event publisher in a codeunit
codeunit 50100 "Customer Balance Manager"
{
    [IntegrationEvent(false, false)]
    procedure OnAfterCalculateCustomerBalance(Customer: Record Customer; var BalanceAmount: Decimal)
    begin
    end;
}
```

#### 2. Configuration Management
```al
// Hypothetical setup table for extension configuration
table 50100 "ALMakeDemo Setup"
{
    fields
    {
        field(1; "Primary Key"; Code[10]) { }
        field(2; "Show Balance Due"; Boolean) { }
        field(3; "Welcome Message Enabled"; Boolean) { }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Interface-Based Extensibility
```al
// Hypothetical interface for customer enhancement
interface "ICustomerEnhancement"
{
    procedure GetAdditionalFields(): List of [Text];
    procedure FormatFieldValue(FieldName: Text; Value: Variant): Text;
}
```

## Integration with Business Central Extension Model

### Standard Extension Compatibility
ALMakeDemo follows Business Central extension best practices:
- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't modify standard objects
- **Upgrade Safe**: Extensions maintain compatibility across BC updates
- **Per-Tenant**: Can be installed per tenant without affecting others
